				LLFALSE
			a portable False compiler

This is llfalse, a compiler for the False programming language based on LLVM.
By using LLVM for code generation the generated code can run on a wide variety
of platforms.

Please note that llfalse is still in early development, and may fail more often
than expected; Bug reports (and patches) are appreciated.

I chose the GPLv2 as the license kind of out of tradition. If you ask me nicely
to give you part of the code under another license, I will consider doing so.
